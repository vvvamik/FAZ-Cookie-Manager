**Tired of cookie consent plugins that lock essential features behind paywalls, require cloud accounts, or send your visitors' data to third-party servers?**

FAZ Cookie Manager is a WordPress plugin that helps you implement cookie consent and privacy workflows for international regulations -- completely free, with no strings attached.

No account to create. No required cloud service to connect. No "premium" plan to unlock basic features like consent logging or geo-targeting. Core consent features run on your own server, and you own all your data.

## Why FAZ Cookie Manager?

Most cookie consent plugins follow the same pattern: a free version with crippled features, and a paid tier starting at $10-50/month that unlocks what you actually need. FAZ Cookie Manager breaks that model:

| Feature | Others (free) | Others (paid) | FAZ Cookie Manager |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cookie banner | Limited | Full | **Full** |
| Cookie scanner | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Consent logging + CSV export | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Google Consent Mode v2 | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| IAB TCF v2.3 + GVL | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Geo-targeting | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Multi-language (180+) | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Cloud dependency | No | **Yes** | **No** |
| Price | Free | $10-50/mo | **Free forever** |

> **A note on IAB TCF v2.3:** The plugin includes a fully functional IAB TCF v2.3 CMP implementation -- TC String encoding, GVL integration, vendor consent UI, and all required `__tcfapi()` commands work correctly. However, for the TC String to be recognized by the ad-tech supply chain, the CMP must be registered with IAB Europe (which requires an annual fee). CMP registration is on the roadmap. If you'd like to help make it happen, consider supporting the project:

- **Commands**: `ping`, `getTCData`, `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, `getVendorList`
- **Global Vendor List (GVL)**: Server-side download and caching of the IAB GVL v3 (1,100+ vendors). Weekly auto-update via WP-Cron, manual update from admin UI
- **GVL Admin Page**: Browse, search, and filter all IAB-registered vendors. Select which vendors your site uses. Paginated table with purpose/feature details
- **Real Vendor Consent**: TC Strings encode actual vendor consent and legitimate interest bits based on user choices and vendor purpose declarations
- **Special Feature Opt-ins**: TCF v2.3 Special Features (precise geolocation, device scanning) mapped from user category consent
- **DisclosedVendors Segment**: Mandatory segment listing all vendors the CMP discloses to users
- **Vendor Legitimate Interest**: Honors user's Right to Object -- LI bits are only set when the user hasn't objected to the corresponding purposes
- **Vendor Consent UI**: Per-vendor toggles in the preference center, with vendor name, purposes, privacy policy link, and cookie retention info
- **TC String**: Full base64url encoding with core segment + DisclosedVendors segment, `euconsent-v2` cookie
- **Cross-frame messaging**: `__tcfapiLocator` iframe + `postMessage` bridge
- **Command queue**: Processes pre-load `__tcfapi.a` queue
- **CMP Stub**: Inline stub responds to `ping` before main script loads (`cmpStatus: 'stub'`)
- **Dynamic config**: ConsentLanguage, publisherCC, gdprApplies, CMP ID, Purpose One Treatment -- all configured from server-side settings
- **GVL file storage**: Cached at `wp-content/uploads/faz-cookie-manager/gvl/vendor-list.json` for frontend access

#### CMP ID and IAB Registration

FAZ Cookie Manager works in two modes:

| Mode | CMP ID | What works | What doesn't |
|------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Self-hosted** (default) | `0` | Banner, cookie blocking, Google Consent Mode v2, consent logging, all admin features | Ad-tech vendors ignore the TC String (unrecognized CMP) |
| **IAB-registered** | Your ID | Everything above **plus** full TCF vendor chain -- SSPs, DSPs, and ad exchanges read and honor the TC String | Requires [IAB CMP registration](https://iabeurope.eu/cmp-list/) (annual fee) |

**When do you need a registered CMP ID?**

- If you run programmatic advertising (header bidding, ad exchanges) and need the buy-side to respect granular vendor consent via the TC String
- If your DPA or legal counsel requires a registered CMP for full TCF vendor-chain support

**When is self-hosted (CMP ID = 0) sufficient?**

- You only need GDPR/ePrivacy-oriented cookie consent tooling (banner + script blocking)
- You use Google Consent Mode v2 (GCM uses its own consent signal channel, independent of TCF)
- You don't participate in the IAB programmatic advertising supply chain

To set your CMP ID: **Settings > IAB TCF v2.3 > CMP ID**

### Microsoft Consent Integration

- **UET Consent Mode**: Sets `ad_storage`/`analytics_storage` defaults to denied, updates on consent
- **Clarity Consent API**: Calls `window.clarity('consent')` when analytics accepted

### Consent Logging

Stores proof of consent in a local database table for GDPR accountability:

- **Consent ID**: Unique per-visitor identifier
- **Status**: accepted, rejected, or partial
- **Categories**: JSON map of which categories were accepted/rejected
- **IP hash**: SHA256 hash (privacy-preserving, no raw IPs stored)
- **Pagination** and **search** in admin UI
- **CSV export** with date-stamped filename
- **Retention period**: Configurable (default: 12 months)

### Pageview Analytics

Built-in analytics dashboard -- no Google Analytics needed for basic metrics:

- **Events tracked**: pageview, banner_view, banner_accept, banner_reject, banner_settings
- **Dashboard charts**: Daily pageview trend, accept/reject rates

### Geolocation

Detects visitor country for geo-targeted banner display:

- **Detection chain**: Cloudflare > Apache mod_geoip > PHP GeoIP extension > local MaxMind GeoLite2 database
- **Geo-targeting modes**: ALL (everyone), EU (EU/EEA + UK), US only, Custom country list
- **Proxy-aware**: Reads `CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP` headers
- **Cached**: 1-hour WordPress transient per IP

### Multilingual Support

- **11 bundled languages**: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese (PT + BR), Hungarian, Finnish, Dutch
- **180+ selectable languages** in the admin configuration
- **Browser language detection**: resolved client-side from `navigator.languages` so full-page/CDN caches cannot serve the wrong language to visitors (see below)
- **Plugin integration**: Polylang, WPML, TranslatePress, Weglot auto-detected (URL-based, always cache-safe)
- **Per-language banner content**: Separate title, description, button text per language
- **RTL auto-detection**: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Kurdish, Urdu

#### Full-page cache and CDN compatibility

When **no URL-based multilingual plugin** (WPML/Polylang/TranslatePress/Weglot)
is installed and **two or more languages** are selected in the admin, the
banner HTML is rendered server-side in the **site default language** so it
stays safe to cache. A `Vary: Accept-Language` response header is emitted for
caches that honour it, and the banner is swapped client-side via
`GET /wp-json/faz/v1/banner/{lang}` when the visitor's browser prefers a
different selected language.

Recommended cache configuration:

- **Cloudflare (APO / Cache Everything / Cache Rules)**: `Vary` alone is not
  sufficient in these modes. Either keep banner pages off "Cache Everything",
  or add a Cache Rule that includes `Accept-Language` in the cache key for
  the affected pages.
- **LiteSpeed Cache**: enable **Cache by language** (Cache → Advanced) or
  exclude banner-bearing pages from HTML caching.
- **WP Rocket**: enable **Cache by language** under Advanced Rules.
- **nginx fastcgi_cache / page caches**: add `$http_accept_language` to the
  cache key.

Escape hatch — disable browser detection entirely (banner always served in
the site default language):

```php
add_filter( 'faz_disable_browser_language_detection', '__return_true' );
```

Disable only the `Vary` header (keep client-side detection active):

```php
add_filter( 'faz_send_vary_header', '__return_false' );
```

## Changelog

### 1.13.12
- **Security**: `consent_revision` cannot be lowered via DevTools manipulation; `target_domains` validates http/https scheme + non-empty host; `necessary`/`uncategorized` categories protected from REST deletion; pageview tracking endpoint only registered when tracking is on; WP-CLI export hardened against null bytes, `..` traversal, and symlink escape.
- **Fix**: `purge_page_caches()` now isolates each cache plugin in try/catch — a failing backend can no longer abort the upgrade and leave `faz_version` un-bumped. `faz_version` is now bumped LAST in `install()` so failed migrations retry on the next admin request. Excluded-pages patterns now strip query string and fragment before matching. `faz_path_matches_pattern()` replaces bare `fnmatch()` for portability and case-insensitivity.
- **Fix**: WCA.js `performance` maps to `statistics` (was incorrectly `functional`); `advertisement` back-compat alias for pre-1.13.5 consent cookies. Croatian locale corrected `hr` → `hr_HR`. `alwaysActive` toggle has a distinct blue colour in default gdpr/ccpa configs.
- **Added**: "Share consent across subdomains" toggle — scopes consent cookie to registrable domain. GitHub Actions Plugin Check workflow on every push/PR.

### 1.13.11
- **Removed (breaking for one feature)**: Banner → **Custom CSS** textarea field. Plugin Review Team flagged free-form CSS injection as "arbitrary code insertion" not permitted on wp.org. The textarea is gone from the admin UI, the REST preview no longer renders `meta.customCSS`, and the public frontend no longer injects it. Existing values stay in `wp_faz_banners` for downgrade safety but are inert. Migration path for users who used this: copy your CSS over to **Customizer → Additional CSS** (built-in WordPress) and target `.faz-consent-container`, `.faz-modal`, `.faz-preference-wrapper` directly.
- **Security**: `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']` in `faz_is_bot()` now wrapped with `sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( … ) )` at the access line — visible to static analysers and the value is also clean before being passed to the public `apply_filters('faz_is_bot', …)` hook.
- **Compliance**: `class-filesystem.php` no longer issues global `define('FS_CHMOD_DIR', 0755)` / `define('FS_CHMOD_FILE', 0644)`. WordPress core uses those same defaults internally when the constants are unset, so removing them is behaviour-preserving on every host that doesn't override them and avoids competing with the site owner's own constants.
- **Compliance**: `wp faz export <path>` (WP-CLI) is now scoped to `wp_upload_dir()`. Default destination is `wp_upload_dir()/faz-cookie-manager/exports/faz-settings-YYYY-MM-DD.json`. Bare filenames are appended to that directory after `sanitize_file_name()`; absolute paths must resolve inside uploads or the command rejects. No more arbitrary filesystem writes.
- **Documentation + safety net**: the `ob_start( [ $this, 'process_output_buffer' ] )` in `frontend/class-frontend.php::start_blocking_buffer()` now carries a block-comment explaining why we don't pair it with an explicit `ob_end_flush()` (it's the WordPress core `template_redirect → buffered final render` pattern; PHP auto-flushes at shutdown). A belt-and-braces `register_shutdown_function()` safety-net is also registered, and verifies via `ob_list_handlers()` that our handler is still on top of the buffer stack before flushing — so we never close someone else's buffer.

### 1.13.10
- **Fix**: Plugin Check `library_core_files` ERROR on `admin/assets/js/cp-api-fetch-polyfill.js` resolved. The polyfill is a structural re-implementation of `wp-includes/js/dist/api-fetch.js` (by design — it recreates `createRootURLMiddleware`, `createNonceMiddleware`, `createPreloadingMiddleware`, `mediaUploadMiddleware`, `fetchAllMiddleware`) and is needed only on ClassicPress 1.x where the bundled WP 4.9-era `wp-api-fetch` lacks `createRootURLMiddleware`. Resolved by **excluding the file from the wp.org-shape ZIP** via `.distignore` (extending the dual-ZIP pattern already used for `run-scan.php`). The GitHub `-full` release ZIP keeps the polyfill for ClassicPress users. `class-admin.php::deregister_api_fetch()` now carries a `file_exists()` guard so the wp.org build is a graceful no-op when the polyfill file is absent.
- **Build**: `.distignore` realigned to `release.md::COMMON_EXCLUDES`. Prior drift caused dev artefacts (`.code-review-graph/`, `graphify-out/`, `.serena/`, `phpstan-bootstrap.php`, `report.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `cookie-banner-compliance-checklist.md`, `biome.json`, etc.) to potentially leak into wp.org submissions when `wp dist-archive` was used (which reads `.distignore`) instead of the inline `zip` flow in `release.md`. Both flows now produce byte-equivalent ZIPs. `release.md` updated to document both wp.org-only exclusions.

### 1.13.9
- **Fix**: Plugin Check `WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped` ERROR on `admin/class-admin.php:462` resolved. The ClassicPress wp.apiFetch polyfill no longer echoes `<script>$polyfill</script>` in `admin_head`; it ships as a static file (`admin/assets/js/cp-api-fetch-polyfill.js`) registered against the `wp-api-fetch` handle, with REST URL + nonce passed via `wp_localize_script('fazApiFetchConfig', ...)`. Behaviour-equivalent, zero inline echo, browser-cacheable.
- **New**: automatic page-cache invalidation on every plugin upgrade — `Activator::install()` fires `Activator::purge_page_caches()` after the version bump so visitors immediately see the up-to-date `_fazConfig` localize block. Best-effort across LiteSpeed Cache, WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, Cache Enabler, SG Optimizer, Hummingbird, Breeze, Autoptimize, WP-Optimize, Comet Cache, and the WP object cache (Memcached/Redis). CDN edges still require a manual purge.

### 1.13.8
- **Fix (#87) — Bricks Builder Video element**: the iframe inside `.brxe-video` (with `aspect-ratio: 16/9` + no explicit width/height on the iframe) now gets a consent placeholder injected synchronously, even when the iframe's `offsetWidth`/`Height` are still 0 at MutationObserver time. The CSS floor (`min-height: 200px`, `aspect-ratio: 16/9` on `.faz-placeholder--video`) takes over when no measurement is available, so the visitor always sees the call-to-action.
- **Fix (#87) — Bricks lightbox-link case**: capture-phase document-level click interceptor in `script.js` catches `<a class="bricks-lightbox" data-pswp-video-url="…">` (and the equivalent Elementor Pro / Divi shapes). If the URL points at a known video host (youtube.com, youtu.be, vimeo.com, dailymotion, wistia, twitch — covering the WATCH-style URLs lightbox links carry, not just the EMBED form Known_Providers indexes) and the visitor hasn't granted the matching category, the click is `preventDefault`'d before the page-builder listener runs and a placeholder is injected inline.
- **Fix (#87) — Banner showing in WP admin / Bricks editor**: `faz_disable_banner()` now recognises Bricks 2.x editor signals (`?bricks=run`, `?bricks_preview`, `?_bricksmode`) and the helper functions `bricks_is_builder()`, `bricks_is_builder_main()`, `bricks_is_builder_iframe()`. The banner pipeline no longer paints over the Bricks visual editor or admin routes.

### 1.13.7
- **Fix (#85)**: GVL update no longer triggers a fatal `Call to undefined function FazCookie\…\wp_tempnam()` on the REST endpoint. The function lives in `wp-admin/includes/file.php`, which is not auto-loaded outside the admin context, and the namespaced caller resolved the unqualified name in the local namespace. Now `\wp_tempnam()` (global) is called and the file is `require_once`'d on demand. Same fix shape applied to `download_url()` in the languages controller.
- **Fix (#87)**: Bricks Builder Video element no longer collapses to zero height when the YouTube iframe is blocked pending consent. `.faz-placeholder--video` keeps its `aspect-ratio: 16/9` and uses `min-width: min(280px, 100%)` so it stays usable on narrow viewports without overflowing.
- **Fix (Gooloo regression)**: comments on sites running wpDiscuz 7.6.x + LiteSpeed Cache + Divi were "completely disfigured" because the `Gravatar` entry in `Known_Providers` was categorised as `functional` and visitors who rejected "functional" had every `<img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/…">` replaced with the 200-px-tall `.faz-placeholder` div, blowing up the thread layout. Recategorised Gravatar to `necessary` (no cookies, no cross-site tracking, part of the WordPress core comment UX). As defence-in-depth, `wpdiscuz_nonce_*` and `comment_author_*` were added to the `is_wp_internal_cookie()` allowlist so a future Known_Providers entry cannot silently reintroduce the breakage.
- **wp.org compliance pass** (ahead of plugin directory submission): `$_COOKIE` sanitization visible at the access-line; `load_plugin_textdomain()` body documented no-op (auto-loaded since WP 4.6); 4× `__($variable, …)` calls in the cookie-table shortcode replaced with verbatim returns; 8 of 10 flagged inline `<script>`/`<style>` migrated to `wp_enqueue_*` / `wp_add_inline_*` (the 3 residuals carry a `phpcs:ignore` + technical justification: ClassicPress polyfill, `<script type="text/template">` inert HTML, AMP `<amp-consent>` runtime); `_faz_first_time_install` transient renamed to `faz_first_time_install` with migration in `Activator::check_for_upgrade()` and fallback read in `faz_first_time_install()`; `permission_callback => __return_true` on the three public REST routes gained explanatory comments documenting the HMAC-token + rate-limit model.

### 1.13.6
- **New**: blocker-template parity with `Known_Providers`. Every provider the runtime already auto-blocks (143 services — Google Analytics, Adobe, Plausible, Clarity, Mixpanel, Segment, Stripe, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Pinterest, Snapchat, Reddit, Outbrain, Yandex, etc.) now appears in WP Admin → Cookies → "Add from template". The picker grows from 11 to 142. Privacy contract unchanged — this is a UI-discovery fix.
- **Internal**: the 131 new templates were generated from `includes/data/known-providers.json` so admin picker and runtime blocker stay in sync.

### 1.13.5
- **New**: Matomo (Piwik) blocker template — selectable as an analytics tool in Cookies → Blocker Templates. Covers self-hosted Matomo, Matomo Cloud, and Matomo Tag Manager, plus the full `_pk_*`, `MATOMO_SESSID`, and `mtm_consent*` cookie family. (Matomo was already auto-detected by the runtime script blocker; this just exposes the entry in the admin picker so it's discoverable.)

### 1.13.4
- **Fix**: `wp_localize_script` / translation payloads (`{handle}-js-extra`, `{handle}-js-translations`) for FAZ scripts now also carry the 5 cache opt-out attrs. Those inline tags don't travel through `script_loader_tag`; added a hook on `wp_inline_script_attributes` (WP 5.7+) so the cache-plugin opt-out applies to them too. Closes a guarantee gap that LiteSpeed Guest Mode was exposing.

### 1.13.3
- **Fix**: banner invisible on first paint when LiteSpeed Cache *Delay JS* had a hand-added entry mentioning `faz-cookie-manager` without the full `wp-content/plugins/` prefix — the 1.13.2 path-anchored scrubber was strict-anchored and skipped those entries; 1.13.3 also matches `faz-cookie-manager` as a complete token while still leaving third-party companion names like `my-integration-faz-cookie-manager-compat.js` untouched. Reported by gooloo.de.

### 1.13.2
- **Fix**: GDPR Strict preset "Customize" button (light-blue text on dark-blue background) — the `classic` template CSS had `color: #1863dc` hardcoded instead of reading the preset's `--faz-settings-button-color`, and `border-color` pointed at the text-colour variable instead of its own. Pattern now matches the other template variants.
- **Fix**: banner invisible on LiteSpeed Guest Mode installs — added the missing `litespeed_optm_gm_js_exc` filter so Guest Mode's separate JS exclude list also recognises our scripts; first-visit paint restored on Guest-Mode-enabled sites.
- **Fix**: alt-asset mode (`faz-fw` alias) children (`faz-fw-gcm`, `faz-fw-tcf-cmp`, `faz-fw-a11y`) now correctly tagged with the cache-plugin opt-out attributes; 1.13.1 missed them because the handle list was hardcoded.
- **Fix**: `litespeed_optm_js_delay_inc` scrubbing now path-anchored (`plugins/faz-cookie-manager/`) so third-party integration entries are never collaterally removed.
- **New**: `faz_auto_exclude_cache_plugins` filter for site admins who want to disable the automatic cache-plugin exclusion block (default `true`).

### 1.13.1
- **Auto-exclude FAZ scripts from cache plugins' Delay JS** — LiteSpeed Cache, WP Rocket, Autoptimize, SG Optimizer, Hummingbird, Cloudflare Rocket Loader and W3 Total Cache all default to deferring every JS file until first user interaction, which kept the consent banner dormant on page load and let trackers fire the moment the user scrolled. The plugin now adds `data-no-defer data-no-optimize data-no-minify data-cfasync="false" data-ao-skip` to every FAZ `<script>` and hooks the matching pattern-based exclude filters so admins no longer need to configure a thing.

### 1.13.0
- **Fix (#80)**: per-service consent cookie stays under the browser's 4 KB limit — `_fazSetInStore` omits `svc.<id>` entries whose value matches the category (the frontend loader already falls back to the category when absent). Previously a ~160-service install made every "Save My Preferences" click a no-op because the oversized write was silently dropped.
- **Fix (#78)**: scanner `discover_urls` places recently-modified pages in `priority_urls` so they're exempt from the client-side early-stop threshold — freshly-edited posts could previously be skipped on large sites.
- **Fix**: `shred_non_consented_cookies()` honours the frontend whitelist payload (was only respected on the first page load, then neutralized on every `send_headers`).
- **Fix**: whitelist pattern match is unidirectional with a minimum-length guard — entering `"js"` or `"com"` no longer whitelists nearly every provider.
- **Fix**: preference center focus-retry timers are cancelled on close (no more focus theft after rapid open/close).
- **Fix**: dynamic scripts preserve their original `type` (`module`, etc.) through the block/unblock round-trip via `data-faz-original-type`.
- **Internal**: provider-matrix fixture serialises hit increments under `flock`, `fazApiPut` uses `X-HTTP-Method-Override` for nginx/Apache/php -S portability, permalink-agnostic scanner discover predicate, deduped `get_priority_urls` WP_Query.

### 1.12.1
- **Fix**: LiteSpeed Cache cookies (`_lscache_vary`, `_litespeed_*`) added to internal whitelist

### 1.12.0
- **Security audit**: closed all findings from 20-agent code audit (H2-H5, M1-M28)
- **data: URI blocking**: decoded payload matched against provider patterns (PHP + JS)
- **Uppercase HTML tags**: `strpos` → `stripos` in output buffer guards
- **Consent logging**: throttle fix for empty consent_id, URL credential stripping, UA hashing
- **TCF/IAB v2.3**: `buildConsentArtifacts`, Purpose 1 treatment, euconsent-v2 cleanup
- **Accessibility**: extended focus trap, summary support, localized aria-labels
- **Performance**: `faz_settings` memoized, N+1 eliminated, `faz_current_language()` cached
- **Plugin Check**: 0 ERRORS — all escaping, WP_Filesystem, and ABSPATH issues resolved
- **Tests**: 35+ new E2E tests (category blocking, audit regressions, session fixes)
- **DB migration 3.4.1**: banner table indexes for existing installs

### 1.11.3
- **New: WP 5.7+ `wp_inline_script_tag` filter** — intercepts inline scripts added via `wp_add_inline_script()` before the output buffer. Backward compatible (WP < 5.7 uses the OB fallback).
- **New: returning visitor unblock retry** — `_fazUnblock()` retries at multiple delays (250ms, 1s, 2s) + load event so late-rendered blocked scripts are always restored.
- **Fix: WordPress Plugin Check errors** — resolved all `OutputNotEscaped`, `MissingTranslatorsComment`, and `NoExplicitVersion` findings for wp.org submission compliance.
- **Fix: inline script whitelist bypass** — `is_whitelisted()` now checks only tag attributes, not the inline body.
- **Refactor: `_fazBuildRestoredScript()` helper** — deduplicated script-cloning logic from `_fazUnblockServerSide()`.

### 1.11.2
- **Fix: preference center invisible on dark design presets** — all 5 presets now include full `preferenceCenter`, `categoryPreview` and `optoutPopup` color palettes (background, text, buttons, toggle states). Previously only the banner bar was styled.
- **Fix: TypeError crash on ChromeOS / PMP-exempt members** — `_fazRenderBanner()` null guard prevents crash when the banner template element is absent (PMP-exempt members, empty cache).
- **Fix: `applyDesignPreset()` deep-replaces preference center and optout popup config** — the old cherry-pick missed toggle states and left stale values across preset switches.
- **Fix: `const _fazGsk = true;` → `var`** for broader browser compatibility in the WP Consent API inline script.
- **Fix: removed `#000000` → transparent skip in template CSS** — High Contrast preset buttons now render as black instead of falling back to the default blue.
- **Internal: `normalizeBannerConfig()`, law-specific sanitization defaults, 6 new E2E regression tests.**

### 1.11.1
- **Fix: banner reappears on every page load (critical)** — the `fazcookie-consent` cookie was written without URL-encoding, so on the next pageview the naive `document.cookie` splitter lost the `,` and `:` separators, `rev` couldn't be extracted, and `isConsentCookieStale()` wiped the cookie every time. URL-encode on write, two-pass decode on read. Reported by a live publisher running 1.11.0 in production.
- **Fix: PMP `exempt_levels` setting didn't persist (critical)** — `Settings::sanitize()` was coercing the CSV input `"2, 3"` to `[]` before `sanitize_option()` could parse it. Excluded keys are now dispatched to their per-key handler first. Without this fix the entire Paid Memberships Pro integration was silently non-functional.
- **Fix: Non-personalized ads fallback also forces `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization` to `denied` in the region-default code path** (not just in `buildConsentState()`). Prevents the first-page `gtag("consent", "default", …)` from being more permissive than the post-"reject all" state.
- **Fix: PMP auto-grant cookie wrote `consent:accepted` but `script.js::_fazUnblock()` gates on `consent:yes`** — exempt members had their scripts server-side-unblocked but client-side-re-blocked. Aligned the token and pinned the literal in a regression assertion.
- **Fix: `setAdditionalConsent(null)` no longer fires during the stale-revision window in `fazcookie_consent_update`** — would otherwise clobber the live GACM provider list with an empty `"1~"`.
- **Fix: Settings page race condition** — if `loadSettings()`'s GET resolved after `invalidateConsents()` bumped `consent_revision`, the form silently reverted the counter. Added a monotonic `settingsRequestId` guard.
- **Fix: Cross-domain consent forwarding regex accepts base64** — old allowlist rejected `+`, `/`, `=`; forwarded consents from multi-domain setups were silently dropped.
- **Fix: `wca.js` and `microsoft-consent.js` requested `.min.js` that does not exist** — those scripts are not in the `build:min` pipeline but reused `$suffix` from `script.js`. On installs with `script.min.js`, WP Consent API and Microsoft UET/Clarity consent integration 404'd. Suffix is now computed per-file.
- **Fix: PMP auto-grant cookie filtered internal/admin categories** — `wordpress-internal` (wp-settings-*, wordpress_logged_in_*) and invisible categories are no longer declared in a visitor's consent record.
- **Fix: changelog wording on NPA fallback** — clarified that with `ad_storage = granted` advertising identifiers can still be written for frequency capping / fraud detection; what NPA removes is profiling and ad-user-data signals, not all cookies.
- **New: Czech (cs_CZ) translation** — 441 fully translated strings (frontend banner, categories, admin UI, shortcodes) contributed by Vaclav. Ships `languages/faz-cookie-manager-cs_CZ.po` and `.mo`.
- **Refactor: `faz_get_cookie_domain()` is now the single source of truth** — `Frontend::get_cookie_domain()` delegates to it; the public-suffix-aware TLD list is no longer duplicated between client-facing and server-facing code paths.

### 1.11.0
- **New: Non-personalized ads fallback for Google Consent Mode** — new setting in `GCM → Advanced`. When a visitor denies marketing consent, `ad_storage` stays `granted` while `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization` are forced to `denied`. This is the Google-sanctioned configuration for serving non-personalized ads to visitors who reject the banner, so publishers still earn ad revenue on those pageviews. Important: with `ad_storage = granted`, advertising cookies and persistent identifiers may still be written and read on the visitor's device — what changes is that those identifiers are not used for building user profiles or personalizing creative (`ad_user_data`/`ad_personalization` being denied). Disabled by default to preserve previous behaviour. See [Google AdSense docs](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/13554116).
- **New: Force re-consent (consent versioning)** — new `Settings → Force re-consent` card with an "Invalidate all consents" button. Clicking it bumps `faz_settings.general.consent_revision`; returning visitors whose stored cookie carries a lower revision see the banner again on their next visit. Useful after changing AdSense/GTM settings or adding new tracking services. The cookie format is backward-compatible: cookies from < 1.11.0 have no `rev` key and are NOT invalidated automatically on upgrade — only once the admin explicitly clicks the button.
- **New: Paid Memberships Pro integration (Pay-or-Accept / PUR model)** — new optional integration. When PMP is installed, a `Settings → Paid Memberships Pro integration` card becomes visible. Admin enters a comma-separated list of PMP level IDs; members of those levels bypass the cookie banner entirely and have consent auto-granted across all categories via a server-side cookie set on `init`. Non-paying visitors follow the standard consent flow. No-op when PMP is not active. Third-party code can override the exemption via the `faz_pmp_user_exempted` filter.
- **Fix: GCM race condition on revisit** — `gcm.js` now emits `gtag("consent", "default", …)` with the cookie-derived granted states directly for returning visitors, instead of `default denied → update granted`. This removes the brief window in which AdSense/GTM would fire the first ad request while consent was still `denied`. Fixes the user report where ads only loaded "after a couple of refreshes or a manual re-accept".
- **Fix: `wait_for_update` default incoherence** — admin UI showed `500` as the default, PHP defaults had `2000`. Aligned both to 500 ms (Google's recommended minimum).

### 1.10.2
- **Fix: preference center text colour on dark-theme host sites** (follow-up to [#57](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/FAZ-Cookie-Manager/issues/57)) — the 1.10.1 fix that added a solid default background to `.faz-preference-center` exposed a pre-existing problem: several rules inside the preference center used `color: inherit`, which on sites with a dark theme (body text set to a light colour) inherited that light colour. The result was unreadable "light on white" text inside the now-white modal. Locked the text colour to `var(--faz-detail-color, #212121)` on `.faz-preference-center`, `.faz-preference`, `.faz-preference-header`, `.faz-footer-wrapper`, `.faz-preference-body-wrapper`, `.faz-accordion-wrapper` and the description paragraphs. The default is dark regardless of host theme, and users can still override the colour from the banner editor because the CSS variable is fed from the stored banner config.
- **Test: new E2E regression for the dark-theme scenario** — injects a dark-theme stylesheet on the host site (`html, body, .wp-site-blocks { background: #0f0f10 !important; color: #e6e6e6 !important }`), opens the preference center, and asserts every text-bearing element (`.faz-preference-center`, `.faz-preference-header`, `.faz-preference-title`, description paragraphs, accordion buttons) has a dark computed `color` instead of the injected light one.

### 1.10.1
- **Fix: preference center transparent background on classic template** — When the banner type is "full-width + pushdown" (which internally maps to the `classic` template), clicking the *Customize* button opened a preference center with no background colour. Root cause: `.faz-preference-center` used `background-color: inherit`, and the classic template wraps it in `.faz-preference-wrapper` (not `.faz-modal`), so there was no ancestor providing a colour — the modal ended up fully transparent. Replaced the `inherit` rule with `background-color: var(--faz-detail-background-color, #ffffff)` so the default is always a solid background, regardless of which template variant is active. Reported as [issue #57](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/FAZ-Cookie-Manager/issues/57).
- **Test: E2E regression for issue #57** — switches the banner to `classic` + `pushdown`, opens the preference center on the frontend, and asserts the computed `background-color` of `.faz-preference-center` is not `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` / `transparent`. Canary for future regressions.

### 1.10.0
- **German (de_DE) translation** — ships `languages/faz-cookie-manager-de_DE.po` and `.mo` covering `[faz_cookie_policy]`, `[faz_cookie_table]`, cookie category names and common banner labels. Fixes the gooloo.de user report where the Cookie Policy shortcode stayed in English on a German-only site because the plugin had no `de_DE.mo` to load.
- **Admin JavaScript i18n infrastructure** — 128 localized keys exposed via `fazConfig.i18n.*`, organized in 8 namespaces (cookies, banner, settings, GCM, consent logs, languages, GVL, import/export, dashboard). Every admin page JS now uses a shared `__(key, fallback)` helper.
- **WordPress.org submission assets** — new `.wordpress-org/` directory with 10 publish-ready screenshots (banner, preference center, dashboard, banner editor, cookies, IAB TCF GVL, consent logs, GCM, languages, settings), a full `PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md` covering the submission checklist, SVN workflow, asset sizing and reviewer Q&A, plus a reproducible Playwright capture script at `scripts/capture-wporg-screenshots.mjs`.
- **New FAQ entries** in `readme.txt`: telemetry, minified JS source and data removal on uninstall — the three questions wp.org reviewers always ask.
- **`.distignore` / release ZIP hardening** — excludes `.wordpress-org/`, `assets/`, `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `tsconfig.json`. Distribution ZIP shrunk from 7.0 MB to 5.6 MB (of which ~2.7 MB is the intentional bundled Open Cookie Database).
- **Fix: cookie definitions metadata normalization** — `Cookie_Definitions::get_meta()` now merges stored meta over a defaults array, so legacy installs upgrading from < 1.9 without the `source` field no longer send the UI down the wrong "downloaded vs. bundled" branch.
- **Fix: `META_KEY` autoload flag** — `update_option( self::META_KEY, …, false )` matches the `OPTION_KEY` pattern, keeping metadata out of the autoload bucket.
- **Fix: `importFailed` i18n string** — now contains the `%s` placeholder expected by `import-export.js`, so the actual error detail is surfaced instead of being silently swallowed by `String.replace('%s', …)`.
- **Fix: GVL admin page fully localized** — 8 previously hardcoded English strings in `admin/views/gvl.php` (heading, buttons, aria labels, placeholder, "All purposes", "Select all on this page", "Save Selection") are now wrapped with `esc_html_e` / `esc_attr_e`.
- **Fix: GVL REST API error message** — `'vendor_ids must be an array.'` is now translatable via `__()`.
- **Fix: JS i18n payload** — replaced 128 `esc_html__()` calls inside the `fazConfig.i18n` array with plain `__()`. HTML-escaped strings like `&quot;` were leaking into the UI because JS `.textContent` and `FAZ.notify()` don't interpret HTML entities.
- **Fix: fully localized `gvl.js` and `settings.js` templates** — "Saved N vendor(s)", "GVL updated vX (N vendors)" and "DB file (size) — Last updated: date" lines (previously mixed English fragments with localized strings).
- **Test: new E2E regression for the gooloo.de scenario** — sets `WPLANG=de_DE`, creates a page with `[faz_cookie_policy]`, asserts German strings render (`Was sind Cookies`, `Notwendige Cookies`, `Cookies verwalten`) and the English fallbacks do **not**. Canary for future regressions if anyone deletes `de_DE.mo` by mistake.
- **Test: E2E teardown hardening** — `pr-regression.spec.ts` WPLANG restore uses the shared `completeAdminLogin` helper and `WP_ADMIN_USER`/`WP_ADMIN_PASS` env variables instead of hardcoded `admin`/`admin`.
- **7 rounds of CodeRabbit review addressed**.

### 1.9.2
- **Fix: language settings controller** — settings API no longer re-injects the default language into the selected list on every read, fully fixing the "English always comes back" bug for non-English sites

### 1.9.1
- **Fix: default language uses site locale** — `faz_default_language()` now falls back to WPLANG (e.g. `de_DE` → `de`) instead of hardcoded `'en'`, so German/French/etc.-only sites work correctly without English being forced back
- **Fix: theme link color bleed** — added CSS reset (`color:inherit`) on `#faz-consent a,button` to prevent Divi, Elementor, and other page builder themes from overriding banner button colors

### 1.9.0
- **WCAG 2.2 accessibility** — new `a11y.js` with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, heading hierarchy (`<h2>`/`<h3>`), `role="switch"` on toggles, dynamic checkbox labels, and Escape key support (contributed by Yard Digital Agency)
- **CSS custom properties** — all banner inline styles replaced with `--faz-*` CSS vars for CSP compatibility and easy theme customization (contributed by Yard Digital Agency)
- **Dutch language** — 573 fully translated strings (contributed by Yard Digital Agency)
- **Admin UI refresh** — modern design system, real-time iframe-based banner preview, design presets
- **Settings save fix** — `array_merge` no longer accumulates duplicates on repeated saves
- **Blocker templates auto-save** — clicking a template now persists rules immediately
- **Security hardening** — SSRF protection on scanner redirects, path traversal sanitization, CSS var name sanitization, ABSPATH guard on autoloader
- **Error handling** — banner API returns `WP_Error` on DB failures (create, update, delete, bulk)
- **Focus management** — preference center restores focus to trigger element on close (WCAG 2.4.3)
- **Performance** — a11y.js loaded in footer (non render-blocking), `.faz-accordion-heading` CSS normalized across all template types
- **10 rounds of CodeRabbit review** — 68+ findings addressed
- **155+ E2E tests** across admin, frontend, scanner, a11y, and blocking flows

### 1.8.0
- **WooCommerce-aware scanner** — auto-discovers shop, product, cart, checkout, my-account pages for comprehensive cookie detection
- **Scanner Debug Mode** — logs every categorization decision, downloadable from admin
- **OCD auto-download** — 7400+ cookie definitions downloaded on activation
- **"Remove all data on uninstall"** — opt-in setting (default OFF) prevents accidental data loss
- **Admin nav bar translated** — all labels now translatable via .po/.mo
- **Inferred cookies use site domain** — no more `googletagmanager.com` as cookie domain
- **Auto-categorize serialized** — no more 503 rate limiting on shared hosts
- **Server-scan always merges** — catches LiteSpeed/WP Rocket deferred scripts

### 1.7.2
- **Per-service cookie shredding** — denied services now have their cookies deleted even when the parent category is consented
- **Scanner 3-tier lookup** — integrates Open Cookie Database (1400+ entries) as fallback, drastically reducing "uncategorized" cookies
- **Blocker templates create cookies** — applying a template now adds cookies to the DB, not just blocking rules
- **French translation** — complete `fr_FR` locale with 579 translated strings (thanks @pascalminator)
- **Cookie_Database expanded** — 40 → 64 entries including `_GRECAPTCHA`, GA Classic, YouTube, Stripe, and more
- **i18n fixes** — scanner uses default language, backend preserves all translation keys, shortcode category names use `localize_category_name()`
- **18 new E2E tests** — comprehensive regression coverage for PRs #39, #41, #44
- **Scanner LiteSpeed/cache compatibility** — reads `data-src` and `data-litespeed-src`, server-side scan always merges, description enrichment from OCD
- **Cache flush after scan** — fixes empty cookie table after scan on sites with object cache

### 1.7.1
- **Admin performance** — 50-68% faster backend navigation (cache fix, N+1 query, REST preloading)
- **User-configurable whitelist** for scripts/network requests with 11 default API patterns (fixes #40)
- **Google Maps TypeError fix** — type guards on all DOM-facing blocking functions (fixes #35)
- **ClassicPress compatibility** — Gutenberg guard, `wp_date` → `date_i18n`
- **Banner type persistence** — fixed incorrect classic↔banner mapping in admin JS

### 1.7.0
- **26 new features** — scheduled scanning, consent stats, cookie policy shortcode, geo-IP banner, visual placeholders, multisite, Gutenberg blocks (3), design presets (5), bot detection, GTM data layer, WP privacy tools, dashboard widget, cross-domain consent, cookie deletion, age protection, anti-ad-blocker, per-service consent, import/export, AMP consent, content blocker templates (10), WP-CLI commands, system status, TranslatePress/Weglot compat, unmatched vendor notification
- **Category editor** — edit category names/descriptions from admin (fixes #38)
- **Custom CSS** — banner custom CSS now saves and renders (fixes #37)
- **Per-service consent** — individual service toggles override category consent
- **Security** — import sanitization, CodeQL DOM XSS resolved, AMP guards, per-service cookie shredding, transactions with ROLLBACK
- **34 new E2E tests** for all features + deep-flow coverage

### 1.6.1
- **Security hardening** — GCM settings sanitisation (whitelist keys, validate values), pageview endpoint HMAC token, scanner SSRF prevention (block private IPs), filter data sanitisation, CSS injection fix
- **Bug fixes** — switch fallthrough, null guards for CCPA/preference/readmore handlers, deprecated `event.which` → `event.key`, double DOM query fix, `.map()` → `.forEach()` cleanup

### 1.6.0
- **WooCommerce compatibility** — auto-whitelists WooCommerce core + payment gateway scripts on checkout/cart pages

## Translations

FAZ Cookie Manager is fully translatable. All admin and frontend strings use WordPress i18n functions (`__()`, `_e()`, `esc_html__()`) with the `faz-cookie-manager` text domain.

**How to translate:**

1. Use the included `.pot` file at `languages/faz-cookie-manager.pot` as a template
2. Create a `.po` file for your language (e.g., `faz-cookie-manager-it_IT.po`) using [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or any gettext editor
3. Compile it to `.mo` and place both files in the `languages/` folder
4. WordPress will automatically load the translation matching your site language

The banner content (title, description, button labels) is configured separately in the admin UI under **Banner → Content** and supports per-language customisation via the **Languages** module.
